# Hi, there. I am Gabriel. Welcome to my repository. 

In this repository, you will find multiple projects I have been working on, projects that span from data cleaning in SQL to data visualization in Tableau.

In the coming weeks, I will be working on projects related to Data Science and Machine Learning, which are my main areas of interest. Stay tuned!

Cheers,

Gabriel
